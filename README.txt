== Dukecord ==
A Discord client made in Java designed to run everywhere. I will likely finish this in a decade.

Although custom clients are against ToS, no one has gotten banned for using Dukecord, because it doesn't even exist.
Do not use this with your main account, since I will fully reimplement gateway, which adds risk of termination. If you do get terminated, open an issue
